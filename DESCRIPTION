Description: The 'ATA' method based on the modified simple exponential smoothing is a new univariate time series forecasting method which 
	provides innovative solutions to issues faced during the initialization and optimization stages of existing methods. 
    Forecasting performance of the 'ATA' method is superior to existing methods both in terms of easy implementation and accurate forecasting. 
    It can be applied to non-seasonal or seasonal time series which can be decomposed into four components (remainder, level, trend and seasonal).
    This methodology performed well on the M3 and M4-competition data.
